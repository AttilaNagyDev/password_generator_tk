# Password Generator
###### A hobby project made in Python TKInter

---------------------------------------

You can set the length of the password and choose to include
+ Small letters
+ Capital letters
+ Numbers
+ Symbols

Once you picked from these types of characters and set the length, 
click on the `Generate Password` button to generate a new password.

Now the password that you can see in the program is also available from your clipboard,
so you can paste it anywhere to use.
