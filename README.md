### Welcome to the Password Generator You Actually Want to Use!

Ever stared at your browser’s password suggestions and thought, “Is this a WiFi password from 2003?”  
Me too. That’s why I made this: a Python + TKInter app that lets you create passwords that are strong, customizable, and not just a random jumble of sadness.

## 🚀 Features

- **Choose your password length:** 8–24 characters (because size matters)
- **Pick your ingredients:**  
  - Small letters (for subtlety)
  - Capital letters (for drama)
  - Numbers (for math fans)
  - Symbols (for those who like to live dangerously)
- **One-click generation:** Hit `Generate New Password` and watch the magic happen
- **Clipboard ready:** Your new password is instantly copied, so you can paste it anywhere

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone this repo  
2. Make sure you have Python installed  
3. Start the app (double-click, terminal, telepathy)

## 🧐 Why Use This?

- Tired of passwords like `qwerty123` or `password1`?  
- Want to feel like a hacker in a movie?  
- Need a password that even your cat can’t guess?  
- Like pressing buttons and seeing cool stuff happen?

If you answered “yes” to any of the above, this app is for you.
