# Password Generator 🔐
###### A hobby project made in Python with TKInter

Somehow, I've never found the suggestions of password managers in browsers good enough,
so I thought I would make something more customizable.
This little application is simple to use, and it can be useful to quickly generate passwords.

You can set the length of the password (8–24 characters) and choose to include:
+ Small letters
+ Capital letters
+ Numbers
+ Symbols

Once you picked from these types of characters and set the length, 
click on the `Generate New Password` button for a new password.

Now the password that you can see in the program is also available from your clipboard,
so you can paste it anywhere to use.
